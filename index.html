        <p>Here is a shortlist to help you set up the VS Code Editor for beginner tutorials.
          There are more than 100, but these are useful and will help you in the tutorials in web development. This is
          something you can always tweak on as you develope your own style and tools preferences. Just know that for
          now, the integration between Git-Hub and Replit is perfect for our needs at this time. </p>

        <p class="date">2022-23-06</p>
        <p>I reached out to UI dev for onboarding to project and to schedule regular meetings during the design phase.
