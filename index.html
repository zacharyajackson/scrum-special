        <p>Here is a shortlist to help you set up the VS Code Editor for beginner tutorials.
          There are more than 100, but these are useful and will help you in the tutorials in web development. This is
          something you can always tweak on as you develope your own style and tools preferences. Just know that for
          now, the integration between Git-Hub and Replit is perfect for our needs at this time. </p>

        <p>Yesterday</p>
        <p class="date">2022-23-03</p>
        <p>I followed up on emails as usual.
          following up in slack and asked a question in ticket for a future seemed to take forever.
          But, I had time to asked/reminded about blocker from Yesterday.
          Had 11:00 meeting which has become quite routine as of late.
          Oh, and last night we had class meeting/did jeopardy style game for terms review.

        <p>Today</p>
        <p class="date">2022-24-03</p>
        <p>I reached out to UI dev for onboarding to project and to schedule regular meetings during the design phase.
          Having engaged w/ #support_questions on answers/clarity,
          I procedded to my daily standup 11:00 w/ Zach where we planned scheduled zoom meeting w/product owner for new
          solutions and discovery needs as consultation and board
          After that I set-up/invites & TODO's for the project owners
          I reported my blocker in adding automation to Jira boards as desired and will have to make a work around.</p>
